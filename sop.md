 Writing High-Converting SaaS Landing Page Copy

Version: 1.0

Purpose: To systematically write landing page copy that converts visitors into users by applying proven psychological frameworks (Hormozi, StoryBrand, Direct Response).

Target Audience: Founders, Copywriters, Marketers.

Phase 1: The Pre-Writing Diagnosis (Do Not Skip)

Before writing a single word, you must define the following three elements. If you cannot answer these, your copy will fail.

1. The Villain (The Enemy)

Question: What specific pain point or manual process is the user currently suffering from?

Example: "Manual data entry," "Chasing clients for invoices," "Spam folders."

2. The Dream Outcome (The Identity)

Question: Who does the user want to become? (Not what tool do they want, but what status?)

Example: They don't want "email software"; they want to be a "Top 1% Creator."

Example: They don't want "fitness app"; they want to be "The fittest person in the room."

3. The Objection (The Friction)

Question: Why are they scared to sign up?

Example: "It takes too long to set up," "I have to talk to a salesperson," "It's too expensive."

Phase 2: The Hero Section (The "Money" Screen)

This is the top 1000px of the page. 80% of your conversions come from here.

Step 1: The Headline (H1)

Goal: Hook the user instantly by promising the Dream Outcome.
Rule: 6-12 words max. Focus on clarity, not cleverness.

Formula A (The Outcome):

[Action Verb] + [Dream Outcome] + without + [The Villain]

🔴 Bad: "The #1 AI Marketing Tool." (Vague, talks about the tool)

🟢 Good: "Automate your daily content creation without hiring an agency." (Talks about the result)

Formula B (The Identity - Linear Style):

The [Adjective] method for [Target Audience] to [Action].

🔴 Bad: "Project management for teams."

🟢 Good: "The modern standard for high-performance engineering teams."

Step 2: The Subheadline (H2)

Goal: Explain how you deliver the promise (The Mechanism) and reduce risk.
Rule: 2 lines max. Use specific numbers if possible.

The Formula:

[Specific Feature] to help you [Benefit 1] and [Benefit 2]. Trusted by [Number] users.

Example: "Syncs with your bank account to categorize expenses automatically. Join 12,000+ freelancers saving 5 hours a week."

Step 3: The Call to Action (CTA)

Goal: Get the click with zero friction.
Psychology: Avoid "Work" words. Use "Reward" words.

🔴 Avoid (High Friction)

🟢 Use (Low Friction / Reward)

Phase 3: The "Value" Stack (Body Copy)

After the Hero section, you must prove your claims.

Step 4: Social Proof (The Trust Bar)

Placement: Immediately visible, often right under the Hero section.
Format:

Logos: "Trusted by teams at [Google] [Uber] [Stripe]"

Metrics: "Processed $10M+ in transactions" (Use exact numbers, not estimates).

Step 5: The "Feature vs. Benefit" Translator

Rule: Never list a feature without a "So That."
Technique: Take a feature, add "So that," and write the result.

Feature (The "What")

The "So That" (The Why)

Final Copy

Real-time Analytics

...so that you can make decisions fast.

"Spot trends instantly and pivot before you lose money."

256-bit Encryption

...so that your data is safe.

"Bank-grade security so you never worry about leaks."

One-click Import

...so that you don't waste time.

"Move your data in seconds, not days."

Step 6: The "Comparison" (The Anchor)

Goal: Anchor your price against something expensive.
Psychology: Price Relativity.

Don't say: "We cost $50/month."

Say: "The power of a $5,000/month agency for just $50."

Phase 4: The Review Checklist (The Audit)

Before publishing, run your copy through this 5-point test.

[ ] The "You" Test: Count how many times you used the word "We/Our" vs. "You/Your."

Goal: "You" should appear 2x more than "We."

[ ] The "So What?" Test: Read every headline. Ask "So what?" If the answer isn't obvious, rewrite it.

[ ] The "Scan" Test: Can you understand what the product does by reading only the bold text?

[ ] The "Specifics" Test: Did you use round numbers (e.g., "fast") or specific numbers (e.g., "2.4 seconds")? Specifics sell.

[ ] The "Mobile" Check: Is the Headline short enough to fit on a phone screen without taking up half the page?
